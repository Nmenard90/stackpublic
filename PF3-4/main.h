Purpose: This header file is prepared for potential future use in the stack project. Currently, 
it does not contain declarations or global variables, but it serves as a placeholder for any 
future needs that may arise during the development or expansion of the stack testing suite.

#include <iostream>
#ifndef MAIN_H
#define MAIN_H

// Since the current main.cpp does not utilize external functions or global variables,
// this file is prepared for future use if such needs arise.

// Example of what might be included if global variables or utility functions were used in main.cpp:

// Global variables (if any were needed)
// extern int exampleGlobalVariable;

// Function prototypes for any utility functions defined in main.cpp or elsewhere
// void exampleUtilityFunction();

#endif // MAIN_H
