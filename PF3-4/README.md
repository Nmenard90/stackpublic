Application
Assignment 4

--Description--

This assignment involves the implementation and testing of a stack data structure using a fixed-size array. The stack supports basic operations such as push, pop, peek, and checking if the stack is empty. Comprehensive testing is conducted to ensure the stack handles underflow and overflow correctly and performs as expected across various scenarios.



--Dependencies--

*g++ compiler for C++**: The application is written in C++ and requires g++ for compiling the source code.

./a.exe to run (windows)

--Usage--

The application is a demonstration of stack operations. It does not require any input, as it's designed to run a series of predefined tests on the stack implementation. These tests include pushing to a full stack, popping from an empty stack, and various other operations to validate the correctness of the stack implementation.
